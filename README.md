#Exploration site
Ive created this static space exploration site using HTML, CSS as a part of my Frontend Developer career path at scrimba.

I've learnt: 
Background-images properties,
Webp format,
importing google fonts,
the <span> tag,
ID's and utility classes,
text-shadowing(improving readiblity).
